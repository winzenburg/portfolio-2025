**Why Most Design Systems Fail (And How to Fix Them)**

Real talk: I've watched this pattern unfold more times than I care to count. Companies invest 12-18 months and nearly $1M building a design system, only to see adoption stuck below 20% six months later. The system becomes shelfware—a beautiful, well-documented artifact that collects digital dust. 

**The Diagnosis:** The problem isn't technical, it's organizational. There are three core issues that kill design systems: 1) Abysmal adoption, 2) Inability to keep up with product evolution, and 3) Paralyzing governance gridlock.

**The Transformation:** I discovered three AI-powered solutions that actually work: 1️⃣ AI-powered documentation that makes the system intuitive and discoverable, 2️⃣ Automated validation and maintenance to keep pace with change, 3️⃣ Data-driven governance that accelerates decisions.

**The Results:** One company I worked with saw adoption skyrocket from 30% to 95% in just 2 months. Maintenance time plummeted from 20 hours per week to 2. Decisions that used to take weeks now resolve in days. The design system became a productivity multiplier, not a source of friction.

**The Lesson:** Traditional approaches fail because they optimize for the build phase, not ongoing adoption and evolution. The key is shipping a minimum viable system in 4-6 weeks, not 18 months. Then use AI to make it accessible, automate maintenance, and leverage data to drive governance decisions.
