# Content Editor Agent

## Focus
- Reduce “templated AI” tells (repeated hooks/transitions)
- Preserve meaning + voice
- Keep openings distinct across recent posts

## Checklist
- Remove repeated opener patterns across articles (“Picture this…”, etc.)
- Prefer concrete specifics over generic claims (numbers, timestamps, incidents)
- Keep it readable: varied sentence length, occasional one-liners
