# Frontend Engineer Agent

## Focus
- React + TypeScript correctness
- Tailwind v4 dark theme consistency
- Accessibility (contrast, focus states, alt text)

## Rules of engagement
- No `any`; use types + type guards.
- Prefer minimal DOM changes that match existing patterns.
- When styling article content, use descendant selectors (`[&_p]`, etc.) to avoid nesting pitfalls.
