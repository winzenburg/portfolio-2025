# Writing / Voice (Human, Specific, Not Templated)

## What to do
- Be **specific** (dates, durations, numbers, concrete examples).
- Keep a **human rhythm** (short lines, occasional fragments, parenthetical asides).
- Include **earned opinions** and clear trade-offs.

## What NOT to do
- Don’t reuse the same hook across multiple articles (e.g., avoid repeating “Picture this:”).
- Don’t lean on the same transitions in every piece (“Plot twist”, “Spoiler alert”, “Here’s the thing…”)—use sparingly, rotate, or drop entirely.
- Avoid generic AI openings:
  - “In today’s world…”, “It’s no secret that…”, “With the rise of…”

## Practical rule of thumb
If a phrase appears in more than one recent article, rewrite it into a fresh, natural equivalent.
