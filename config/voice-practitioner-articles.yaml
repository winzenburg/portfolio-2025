# WRITING PRINCIPLES
# ============================================================================

writing_principles:

  start_with_a_hook:
    description: "Lead with something that makes people think 'wait, what?' or 'oh, I've felt that!'"
    examples:
      good:
        - "Last Tuesday, I validated three product ideas while waiting for my coffee to brew. No, I'm not a wizard—just someone who finally figured out how to use Perplexity properly."
        - "I spent six months building the wrong product. Then I spent six hours with AI tools and discovered what I should've built all along."
      avoid:
        - "AI is revolutionizing product management. Let's explore how."
        - "This article will teach you about AI validation."

  use_real_stories:
    description: "Anecdotes beat abstractions. Share the messy middle, not just the polished outcome."
    examples:
      good: "My first attempt at AI-powered research? I asked ChatGPT to analyze my market and got back what can only be described as confident nonsense. Here's what I learned from that face-plant..."
      bad: "AI tools can sometimes produce inaccurate results."

  be_the_knowledgeable_friend:
    description: "You're sharing insights over drinks, not lecturing from a stage"
    voice_attributes:
      - "Say 'I' and 'you' liberally—it's a conversation"
      - "Share honest reactions: 'This blew my mind' or 'I was skeptical at first'"
      - "Admit when something surprised you or when you were wrong"
      - "Use casual transitions: 'Here's the thing though...' 'But wait, there's more' 'Plot twist:'"
      - "Parentheticals are your friend (see what I did there?)"

  make_complexity_approachable:
    description: "Never dumb it down, but always make it accessible"
    techniques:
      - "Use analogies from everyday life"
      - "Break down jargon: 'LLMs—fancy term for AI models that predict text really well'"
      - "Explain the 'why' before the 'how'"
    examples:
      good: "Prompt engineering sounds intimidating, but it's basically just learning to talk to a very literal but helpful colleague."
      bad: "Implement vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities."

  inject_personality:
    description: "Your writing should sound unmistakably like YOU"
    personality_markers:
      - "Light humor and wit (but not at the expense of clarity)"
      - "Self-deprecating jokes when you've screwed up"
      - "Genuine enthusiasm when something works well"
      - "Playful asides and callbacks"
      - "The occasional emoji (sparingly—not every paragraph)"
      - "Pacing that breathes—short sentences for impact, longer ones for explanation"

    examples:
      - "Spoiler alert: the first three tools I tried were absolute duds. But #4? *Chef's kiss*"
      - "I've made every mistake in this article. Multiple times. Consider this your shortcut to my hard-earned wisdom."
      - "Is this the sexiest part of product management? Nope. Is it the part that'll save you 20 hours a week? You bet."

  authoritative_not_arrogant:
    description: "Share expertise with humility—you're a guide, not a guru"
    authority_signals:
      - "Specific numbers and data points"
      - "References to frameworks and methodologies"
      - "Citing credible sources"
      - "Technical accuracy"
    humility_signals:
      - "Sharing failures alongside successes"
      - "Admitting when you changed your mind"
      - "Crediting others' ideas"
      - "'In my experience' rather than 'always do this'"

# ============================================================================
# WRITING STYLE MECHANICS
# ============================================================================

writing_style:

  sentence_structure:
    - "Mix it up: Short punchy sentences. Followed by longer, more explanatory ones that unpack the details."
    - "Use fragments. For emphasis."
    - "Active voice 90% of the time"
    - "Front-load important info—readers skim"
    - "One idea per paragraph (but paragraphs can be one sentence)"

  paragraph_flow:
    - "Start with a hook or topic sentence"
    - "Build to a point or insight"
    - "End with something quotable or actionable when possible"
    - "Vary paragraph length—walls of text kill engagement"

  rhythm_and_pacing:
    - "Use white space generously"
    - "Lists and bullets give eyes a rest"
    - "Pull quotes or callouts for key insights"
    - "Short paragraphs = faster pacing = more energy"
    - "Longer paragraphs = breathing room for complex ideas"

  transitions:
    conversational:
      - "Here's the thing..."
      - "But wait, there's a catch:"
      - "Plot twist:"
      - "Now, you might be wondering..."
      - "So what does this actually mean for you?"
      - "Let me back up for a second..."
      - "Quick side note:"
      - "The TL;DR?"

    avoid_these:
      - "Moreover..."
      - "In conclusion..."
      - "It should be noted that..."
      - "Furthermore..."

# ============================================================================
# CONTENT STRUCTURE TEMPLATES
# ============================================================================

article_structure:

  opening_formulas:

    story_hook:
      pattern: "Story/anecdote → surprising insight → what they'll learn"
      example: "Last month I watched a PM spend 40 hours on competitive research. I did the same research in 3 hours using AI. The results? Nearly identical. The difference? I knew which questions to ask. Here's the framework..."

    provocative_statement:
      pattern: "Counterintuitive claim → why it matters → proof points coming"
      example: "The best product managers I know don't use AI to make decisions—they use it to make better questions. Sounds backwards, right? Stick with me..."

    relatable_pain_point:
      pattern: "Familiar frustration → 'you're not alone' → solution preview"
      example: "If you've ever stared at a blank PRD wondering where to even start, you're in good company. I've been there. So has every PM I know. But here's what changed for me..."

  middle_sections:

    explanation_pattern:
      - "What it is (simple definition)"
      - "Why it matters (the 'so what')"
      - "How it works (mechanics)"
      - "Real example (make it concrete)"
      - "Try it yourself (actionable step)"

    framework_pattern:
      - "The problem this solves"
      - "Core principle/philosophy"
      - "Step-by-step breakdown"
      - "See it in action (example)"
      - "Common pitfalls"
      - "Quick wins"

  closing_formulas:

    call_to_action:
      pattern: "Recap key point → immediate next step → bigger vision"
      example: "The AI landscape is moving fast, but you don't need to learn everything. Pick one tool, master one workflow, see real results. Then iterate. That's how you go from overwhelmed to unstoppable."

    thought_provoking:
      pattern: "Summary → broader implication → question to ponder"
      example: "We've covered the tactics, but here's the strategic question: in a world where anyone can generate content with AI, what makes yours worth reading? Hint: it's not the AI—it's the insight only you can provide."

# ============================================================================
# LANGUAGE & WORD CHOICE

      - "After that: just 'LLMs'"
      - "Link to deeper explanations for complex topics"

  humor_guidelines:
    do:
      - "Self-deprecating humor about your own mistakes"
      - "Gentle industry in-jokes (if you explain them)"

# ============================================================================
# VOICE CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST
# ============================================================================

before_publishing_ask:
  - "Does this sound like me, or could it have come from anyone?"
  - "Would I actually say this over coffee with a colleague?"
  - "Is there at least one moment that makes someone smile or think 'huh, interesting'?"
  - "Am I sharing genuine insight, or just restating common knowledge?"
  - "Have I earned the reader's time with something valuable?"
  - "Does this help someone do their job better, or am I just showing off?"
  - "Is my personality coming through without overwhelming the substance?"

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLES: BEFORE & AFTER
# ============================================================================

voice_transformations:

  example_1:
    before: "It is recommended that product managers utilize AI tools to enhance their market validation processes."
    after: "Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier: AI can cut your validation time from weeks to days. No joke. Here's how..."

  example_2:
    before: "The implementation of AI in product workflows requires careful consideration of multiple factors."
    after: "Look, I've face-planted enough times to know: throwing AI at your workflow without a plan is like adding rocket fuel to a shopping cart. Exciting? Sure. Effective? Not so much."

  example_3:
    before: "Perplexity AI is a research tool that can assist with market analysis."
    after: "Perplexity is basically Google if Google actually answered your question instead of making you dig through ten blog posts. For market research, it's a game-changer."
