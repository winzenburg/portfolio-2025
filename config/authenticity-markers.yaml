# Authenticity Markers - Making AI Content Sound Human

# The Problem with AI Writing:
# It's too perfect, too polished, too "helpful assistant" energy.
# Real humans have quirks, make digressions, use specific phrases repeatedly.

# This file defines YOUR authentic voice markers that make content sound like YOU wrote it.

# ============================================================================
# PERSONAL VOICE SIGNATURES
# ============================================================================

voice_signatures:

  recurring_phrases:
    # These are YOUR go-to expressions (use liberally)

  sentence_quirks:
    # Natural speech patterns that show personality
    - "Use fragments. For emphasis."
    - "One-sentence paragraphs? Totally fine."
    - "Parentheticals everywhere (seriously, use them liberally)"
    - "Questions to the reader? Makes it conversational."
    - "Occasional em-dashes—they add rhythm and feel natural"
    - "Start sentences with 'And' or 'But' (grammar police can cope)"

    # Show REAL reactions, not generic enthusiasm
    honest_reactions:
      - "This blew my mind:"
      - "I was skeptical at first, but..."

    genuine_uncertainty:
      - "I'm still figuring this out, but here's what I know so far:"
      - "Your mileage may vary, but..."
      - "I'm not 100% sure on this, but..."

# ANTI-AI PATTERNS (What to AVOID)
# ============================================================================

avoid_these_ai_tells:

  generic_openings:
    never_use:
      - "In today's fast-paced world..."
      - "As we all know..."
      - "It's no secret that..."
      - "In recent years..."
      - "The digital landscape is evolving..."
      - "With the rise of..."

    why: "These scream AI-generated content. Too generic, no personality."

    use_instead:
      - "Last Tuesday, I..."
      - "Remember when I said..."

      - "Moreover..."
      - "Additionally..."
      - "Subsequently..."
      - "In conclusion..."

    use_instead:
      - "Oh, and another thing:"
      - "Quick side note:"
      - "Before I forget:"
      - "This reminds me:"
      - "OK, so:"

    avoid:
      - "Every paragraph perfectly structured"
      - "Every sentence the same length"
      - "No tangents or asides"
      - "Everything flows too smoothly"

    why: "Real humans digress, backtrack, add asides."

      - "Wait, I should mention something first..."
      - "(Quick tangent: this is important)"
      - "Actually, scratch that—here's a better example:"

      - "One might consider..."
      - "It's worth mentioning..."
      - "Users may find..."
      - "Consider the following..."

    why: "Too cautious, too 'helpful AI assistant' energy."

    use_instead:
      - "Here's what matters:"
      - "You should know:"
      - "Don't skip this part:"
      - "You'll notice that..."
      - "Check this out:"

# AUTHENTICITY TECHNIQUES
# ============================================================================

authenticity_techniques:

  1_specific_details:
    rule: "Generic = AI. Specific = Human."

    examples:
      bad: "I recently tested an AI tool."
      good: "Last Tuesday at 3 PM, I tested Perplexity for 47 minutes."

      bad: "This saved me a lot of time."
      good: "This turned a 6-hour task into 22 minutes."

      bad: "Many product managers struggle with this."
      good: "I asked 23 PMs on LinkedIn—19 said this was their #1 pain point."

  2_imperfect_storytelling:
    rule: "Real stories have messy middles, false starts, and backtracking."

    techniques:
      - "Start a story, pause to explain context, then continue"
      - "Mention something, say 'wait, I should back up...'"
      - "Change your mind mid-explanation: 'Actually, that's not the best example...'"
      - "Admit you forgot to mention something earlier"

    example: |
      "So I tried Perplexity for market research. Actually, wait—I should
      mention I'd already wasted 3 hours on Google at this point. Anyway,
      Perplexity gave me... OK, before I tell you what it gave me, you need
      to know what question I asked, because that's the whole trick."

  3_show_personality_quirks:
    rule: "Perfect writing is suspicious. Quirks are human."

    quirks_to_include:
      - "Occasional typo-like informality: 'gonna', 'wanna', 'kinda'"
      - "Emphasis through capitalization: 'This is HUGE.'"
      - "Repeating words for emphasis: 'I mean really, really important.'"
      - "Using numbers unconventionally: '3.7 examples' instead of 'several'"
      - "Invented words: 'validat-ey' or 'research-y' feeling"
      - "Pop culture references (if they fit): 'This is the Thanos snap of AI tools'"

  4_admit_limitations_honestly:
    rule: "AI tries to be helpful about everything. Humans have blind spots."

    honest_admissions:
      - "I haven't tried this on enterprise-scale projects, so grain of salt."
      - "This works for me, but I'm a solo founder. YMMV on a team."
      - "Full disclosure: I suck at [X], so I outsource it."
      - "I probably should test this more, but here's what I've seen so far:"
      - "I'm biased because I love this tool, but objectively..."

  5_conversational_asides:
    rule: "Talk TO the reader, not AT them."

    techniques:
      - "You know that feeling when... [relatable situation]"
      - "Raise your hand if you've... (yeah, thought so)"
      - "Before you ask: yes, I tried that. Didn't work."
      - "I can hear you asking: 'But what about...'"
      - "Look, I get it—this sounds [too good to be true/complicated/weird]"

  6_real_mistakes_and_failures:
    rule: "Share the L's, not just the W's."

    failure_patterns:
      - "First time I tried this? Complete disaster. Here's what went wrong:"
      - "I spent $500 learning this the hard way so you don't have to:"
      - "My first three attempts looked like [embarrassing description]"
      - "I confidently told my team this would work. Narrator: It didn't."
      - "The emails I got after publishing that? Oof. Let me clarify..."

  7_unpolished_thinking:
    rule: "Show your thought process, not just conclusions."

    thinking_out_loud:
      - "My first instinct was [X], but then I realized..."
      - "I went back and forth on this like five times..."
      - "Part of me thinks [X], but another part says [Y]..."
      - "I'm still not sure if this is the best approach, but..."
      - "OK, hear me out—this is going to sound weird at first..."

# ============================================================================
# AUTHENTICITY INJECTION POINTS
# ============================================================================

where_to_inject_authenticity:

  opening_paragraph:
    - "Start mid-story, not with context"
    - "Use a specific time: 'Last Tuesday' not 'Recently'"
    - "Include a surprising detail or number"
    - "Show personality immediately"

    example: |
      BAD: "In recent years, AI tools have transformed how we validate products."

      GOOD: "Last Tuesday at 3:47 PM, I validated three product ideas while
      my coffee was getting cold. No, I'm not a productivity guru—I just
      finally figured out how to use Perplexity without drowning in
      hallucinated nonsense."

  framework_sections:
    - "Admit which step you struggled with most"
    - "Include a 'common mistake' that you personally made"
    - "Use real numbers: '23 minutes' not 'about 20 minutes'"
    - "Show the messy reality: 'Steps 1-3 were easy, Step 4 kicked my ass'"

  examples_and_case_studies:
    - "Use YOUR actual examples, with real dates and numbers"
    - "Include what DIDN'T work: 'I also tried [X], it was terrible'"
    - "Show decision-making: 'I almost gave up after...'"
    - "Include unexpected details: 'The meeting got interrupted by...'"

  conclusion:
    - "End with something quotable but imperfect"
    - "Acknowledge you might be wrong about something"
    - "Invite disagreement: 'Tell me if I'm wrong about...'"
    - "Show ongoing learning: 'I'm still experimenting with...'"

# ============================================================================
# WORD CHOICE AUTHENTICITY
# ============================================================================

word_choice_rules:

  favor_concrete_over_abstract:
    abstract: "optimize", "leverage", "utilize", "implement"
    concrete: "make faster", "use", "use", "set up"

  favor_active_over_passive:
    passive: "It was discovered that the tool could be used for..."
    active: "I discovered the tool works great for..."

  favor_specific_over_generic:
    generic: "various tools", "several options", "multiple approaches"
    specific: "3 tools", "Perplexity and ChatGPT", "the framework I showed above"

  use_contractions:
    formal: "I have", "you are", "it is", "do not"
    conversational: "I've", "you're", "it's", "don't"
    rule: "Use contractions 90% of the time. Avoid them only for emphasis."

# ============================================================================
# RHYTHM AND PACING AUTHENTICITY
# ============================================================================

rhythm_rules:

  vary_sentence_length:
    pattern: "Short. Medium length to explain. Then a longer sentence that really digs into the details and shows you're thinking it through carefully."

    bad_example: |
      "AI tools are useful. They save time. They improve quality.
       They reduce costs. Many teams use them."

    good_example: |
      "AI tools are useful. But here's the thing—they're only useful if
       you know what questions to ask. I learned this after spending $200
       on a tool that gave me confident answers to the wrong problems."

  use_paragraph_breaks_for_emphasis:
    technique: "One-sentence paragraphs are powerful."

    example: |
      "I tested 47 different prompts.

      Know how many actually worked?

      Three.

      That's it. Three prompts out of 47 gave me actionable insights."

  natural_digressions:
    technique: "Real humans get sidetracked. Embrace it."

    example: |
      "So I opened Perplexity and—quick tangent: if you haven't tried
      Perplexity yet, stop reading and go test it for 10 minutes. Seriously,
      I'll wait. It's that good. OK, you're back? Great—so I asked it..."

final_authenticity_check:

  read_it_out_loud:
    test: "If you wouldn't say it in a conversation, rewrite it."
    red_flags:
      - "Sounds too formal or academic"
      - "Sounds like a press release"
      - "Sounds like a LinkedIn thought leader parody"
      - "You stumble over complex sentence structure"

  check_for_personality:
    questions:
      - "Does this sound like ME specifically, or could anyone have written it?"
      - "Did I include at least one personal story or specific example?"
      - "Are there at least 2-3 of my recurring phrases?"
      - "Did I admit at least one mistake or limitation?"
      - "Would my friends recognize my voice in this?"

  check_for_ai_tells:
    scan_for:
      - "Too many transition words (moreover, furthermore, additionally)"
      - "Every paragraph is exactly 3-4 sentences"
      - "No fragments, no one-sentence paragraphs"
      - "No contractions"
      - "Too balanced and diplomatic (no strong opinions)"
      - "No emotional reactions (surprise, frustration, excitement)"

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE: BEFORE AND AFTER
# ============================================================================

before_after_examples:

  example_1:
    before_ai_sounding: |
      "In recent years, AI-powered tools have revolutionized the product
      validation process. By leveraging these technologies, product managers
      can significantly reduce the time required to validate market demand.
      It's important to note that proper implementation is crucial for success."

    after_authentic: |
      "Last month I validated three ideas in the time it used to take me to
      validate one. Not because I got faster at interviews—because I finally
      figured out how to use AI without it hallucinating competitor names that
      don't exist. (Yes, that happened. Twice.)"

    what_changed:
      - "Added specific timeframe: 'Last month' not 'Recently'"
      - "Personal voice: 'I validated' not 'product managers can'"
      - "Specific detail: 'three ideas' not vague improvement"
      - "Admitted a mistake: hallucination story"
      - "Parenthetical aside with humor"
      - "Removed corporate speak: 'leverage', 'implementation', 'crucial'"

  example_2:
    before_ai_sounding: |
      "There are several approaches to market validation. One can utilize
      keyword research tools to identify demand signals. Additionally,
      competitive analysis provides valuable insights. Furthermore, customer
      interviews are essential for understanding pain points."

    after_authentic: |
      "Here's what worked for me: keyword research first (30 minutes with
      Keywords Everywhere), then Perplexity for deep dives (2 hours), then—
      and this is the part I kept screwing up—actually talking to 5 real humans
      to validate what the AI told me. Because AI hallucinates. A lot."

    what_changed:
      - "Made it personal: 'worked for me' not 'one can'"
      - "Specific tools and timeframes"
      - "Admitted struggle: 'kept screwing up'"
      - "Conversational aside with em-dash"
      - "Strong opinion: 'AI hallucinates. A lot.'"
      - "Removed academic transitions: 'Additionally', 'Furthermore'"
