# POST STRUCTURE
# ============================================================================

post_structure:

  tuesday_article_announcement:
    format: "150-200 words"
    structure: |
      1. Hook: Specific story of failure or breakthrough (2-3 sentences)
      2. The lesson/insight from that experience (1-2 sentences)
      3. The framework/approach you built (2-3 sentences woven as narrative)
      4. The measurable outcome (1-2 sentences)
      5. CTA: Link to full article
      6. Hashtags: 3 max

    example: |
      Watched a Fortune 500 team spend 8 months building something nobody wanted. $3M in engineering costs, dead on arrival.

      The painful part? We could've validated demand in 48 hours with the right AI tools.

      Managing 300+ products taught me this: market validation isn't research theater—it's capital protection. I built a framework that turns weeks of guesswork into days of data-backed decisions.

      The shift? Stop asking "can we build this?" Start asking "should we build this?" AI answers the second question faster than your team can answer the first.

      Reduced our research cycles from 3 weeks to 2 days. Team now spends time on strategy, not spreadsheets.

      Full breakdown in today's article (link in comments).

  thursday_engagement_post:
    format: "200-300 words"
    structure: |
      1. Provocative question or insight (1-2 sentences)
      2. The enterprise context (2-3 sentences)
      3. Data or framework (2-3 sentences)
      4. The strategic takeaway (1-2 sentences)
      5. Real question to audience (1 sentence)
      6. Hashtags: 3 max

    example: |
      Here's a question that makes product teams uncomfortable: How much did your last failed feature cost?

      Most teams don't know. They shipped it, it didn't work, they moved on. But at enterprise scale (300+ products), those costs compound fast.

      We started tracking validation rigor vs. feature success rate. The correlation was brutal. Features we validated properly? 78% success. Features we "just knew" would work? 31%.

      The gap between those numbers is millions in wasted engineering time.

      Market validation isn't about slowing teams down—it's about not building the wrong thing fast. Big difference.

      What's your team's validation process before committing to a feature? Genuinely curious what's working for others.
