              Step 1: Keyword Research Validation
            </h3>

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Before you even have a product idea, you need to understand what people are searching for. Tools like Keywords Everywhere, Ahrefs, and SEMrush are invaluable here. The goal is to identify keywords and phrases with significant search volume and relatively low competition.
