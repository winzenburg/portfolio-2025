            <p className="text-xl text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              Once you've successfully launched and monetized your MVP, it's time to think about scaling. There's a powerful alternative to the traditional approach: the portfolio method.

              For many entrepreneurs, scaling means pouring all of their resources into growing a single product. But there's another way: the portfolio approach. This is about building a complementary ecosystem of businesses that are all powered by AI and automation.

              The Portfolio Approach
            </h2>

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The portfolio approach is about building a collection of small, niche businesses that are all related to each other. This allows you to cross-promote your products, share resources, and create a flywheel effect that drives growth across your entire portfolio.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Here's how to implement the portfolio approach:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-slate-300 space-y-3 mb-6 ml-4">
              <li><strong className="text-white">Identify Complementary Niches:</strong> Start by identifying complementary niches that are related to your existing product. What are the other pain points that your target audience has? What are the other products that they are using?</li>
              <li><strong className="text-white">Build or Acquire New Products:</strong> Once you've identified a complementary niche, you can either build a new product from scratch or acquire an existing one. The key is to look for products that are a good fit for your portfolio and that have the potential for growth.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-white">Create a Unified Brand:</strong> As you build out your portfolio, it's important to create a unified brand that ties all of your products together. This will not only make it easier for users to discover your other products but also create a sense of trust and loyalty.</li>
            </ul>
