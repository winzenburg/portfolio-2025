## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these:

- [ ] Visit `/articles` - verify all 8 new articles appear
- [ ] Test category filter "AI Workflow" - should show 18 articles
- [ ] Test category filter "Engineering" - should show 13 articles
- [ ] Click each new article link - verify it loads correctly
- [ ] Check mobile responsive design on all new articles
- [ ] Verify newsletter signup forms work
- [ ] Test internal article links ("Read Next" sections)
- [ ] Check hero images load (placeholders for now)
