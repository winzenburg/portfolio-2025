# The Problem: Why Most SaaS Startups Fail Before They Even Start

90% of SaaS startups fail. But what if the problem isn't the idea—it's the process?

As someone who's been in the SaaS trenches for over a decade, I've seen too many promising ideas crash and burn before they even got off the ground. The statistics are sobering: around 90% of SaaS startups ultimately don't make it. But the culprit may not be the ideas themselves—it could be the process (or lack thereof) that founders use to validate and build their products.

## Introduction
After years of building and failing, I've identified a pattern in what causes most SaaS startups to crash. The good news is, these problems are solvable with a systematic approach. In this article, I'll share the key problems that plague most SaaS startups, and the frameworks that can help solve them.

## The Build Trap
One of the most common pitfalls is the "build trap" — founders getting enamored with building a product before properly validating the underlying demand. They have a great idea, get excited, and start coding without first confirming that a tribe of real humans urgently wants what they're building.

This is where a desirability-first approach shines. The idea is to validate demand through a series of low-cost tests — things like fake door campaigns, concierge MVPs, and preorder offers. The goal is to confirm that there's a high-heat community who would be genuinely upset if the product disappeared. Only once that desirability signal is clear do you move on to building.

Unfortunately, even when founders do this type of demand validation, they often still miss a critical piece of the puzzle: durability. Just because people want something now doesn't mean they'll still want it (and keep paying for it) 12-36 months down the line. This is the "durability problem."

## The Durability Problem
Even if you've validated desirability, your product can still fail if it lacks defensibility and long-term stickiness. This is the "durability problem" — will this still matter and keep paying 12-36 months from now?

To assess durability, consider factors like:
- **Frequency of the Job**: How often does the core job occur (daily/weekly vs. one-time)?
- **Economic Buyer Has Budget**: Is the buyer spending budgeted or discretionary funds?
- **Problem Exists Independent of Hype**: Is this a structural pain point or a trend-driven need?
- **Users Would Be Upset If It Disappeared**: How critical is the solution to users' workflows?
- **Clear Path to Switching Costs**: Can you build in deep integration and lock-in?

Score these criteria on a 1-5 scale, with anything above 18 considered a "durable market" — the kind of compounding SaaS asset you want to build. Anything below 10 is likely a "low durability" play, better suited for short-term revenue than long-term defensibility.

## The Portfolio Problem
Even when founders do validate both desirability and durability, they often run into another challenge: the "portfolio problem." Solo founders and small teams simply can't afford to bet everything on a single idea. If that one product fails, the whole startup fails.

That's why a portfolio approach makes sense — running multiple product bets in parallel. You use a systematic validation process to quickly assess ideas, kill the weak ones, and double down on the strongest opportunities. This diversification protects you from the volatility of any single product's success or failure.

## The Documentation Problem
Another common issue is the "documentation problem." As a product creation process gets more complex, with multiple workstreams and contributors, knowledge and processes tend to get lost. Workflows aren't repeatable, and institutional memory fades over time.

To solve this, you need a comprehensive documentation system that captures every step of your product creation process. From Insight & Narrative Briefs to Moat & MRR Strategies to Feature Implementation Playbooks, a centralized knowledge base ensures consistency and repeatability.


## The AI Problem
Finally, the rise of powerful AI tools like ChatGPT has introduced a new challenge: the "AI problem." These tools are incredibly useful for tasks like content creation, ideation, and even code generation. But they're often disconnected from the broader product creation system, lacking the context, citations, and systematic workflow that would make them truly effective.

The solution is to integrate AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and other tools into a systematic workflow with clear handoffs, citations, and quality gates. Instead of using AI in isolation, you need to connect these tools into your overall product creation system so they work together rather than as disconnected islands.

## Solving Both Desirability and Durability
The key insight is that you need to solve BOTH the "will people want this?" problem AND the "will they keep paying 12-36 months from now?" problem (durability). Most validation frameworks stop at demand validation — but you need to go further, ensuring your products not only have heat, but also the defensibility and retention mechanics to become durable, compounding SaaS businesses.

## Putting It All Together
So, what does a complete product creation system look like? It's a four-phase approach that combines desirability-first validation with durability and defensibility assessment:

1. **Insight, Narrative & Desirability**: Validate that a tribe of real humans urgently wants this (Heat Filter).
2. **Durability & Defensibility**: Ensure this will still matter and keep paying 12–36 months from now (Durability Filter).
3. **Product Design**: Design user experience and interaction flows that deliver the narrative.
4. **Engineering**: Build the feature to PRD/ADR/tests with small diffs, MVP-first.

At each phase, you need clear roles (strategists, researchers, architects, and engineers) who collaborate to produce the necessary artifacts and validate the work against clear quality gates. And you run this process in parallel across multiple ideas, diversifying your portfolio to protect against individual failures.

## Practical Application
So, what does this mean for you as a SaaS founder or product creator? Here are a few key things you can do:

1. **Validate Desirability AND Durability**: Don't just focus on demand validation — also assess the long-term defensibility and stickiness of your product idea.
2. **Build a Systematic Process**: Document your workflows, define clear roles and responsibilities, and create reusable templates and playbooks that make knowledge repeatable.
3. **Integrate AI Intelligently**: Leverage powerful AI tools, but make sure they're fully integrated into your overall product creation system with clear workflows and quality gates.
4. **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Don't bet the farm on a single idea. Run multiple bets in parallel, using a consistent validation process to quickly kill weak ideas and double down on winners.

## Limitations and Trade-Offs
Of course, this systematic approach isn't a silver bullet. There are still plenty of challenges and trade-offs to navigate:

- **Upfront Investment**: Building a comprehensive product creation engine requires significant upfront investment in tooling, documentation, and team coordination.
- **Slower Iteration**: The rigorous validation process can make it harder to rapidly iterate on ideas, especially in fast-moving markets.
- **Complexity Management**: Maintaining a multi-agent, multi-phase system requires careful orchestration and communication.
- **Talent Acquisition**: Finding the right mix of strategists, researchers, architects, and engineers can be difficult.

But for founders and teams who are serious about building durable, defensible SaaS businesses, the benefits far outweigh the costs. By solving both the desirability and durability problems upfront, you set yourself up for long-term success.

## Takeaways
Here are the key takeaways from this article:

1. **The Build Trap**: Most founders build before validating, leading to desirability problems.
2. **The Durability Problem**: Even validated products fail because they lack defensibility and long-term stickiness.
3. **The Portfolio Problem**: Solo founders and small teams can't afford to bet everything on one idea.
4. **The Documentation Problem**: Knowledge gets lost, and processes aren't repeatable.
5. **The AI Problem**: AI tools are powerful but disconnected from a systematic workflow.

These problems are solvable by blending desirability validation with durability and defensibility assessment. What if you could validate both before writing a single line of code? That's the promise of a systematic, two-filter approach to product creation.

The goal isn't to build everything—it's to build the right things, validated both for immediate demand and long-term sustainability. That's how you avoid becoming another statistic in the 90% failure rate.
