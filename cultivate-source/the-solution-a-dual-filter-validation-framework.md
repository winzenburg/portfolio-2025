# The Solution: A Dual-Filter Validation Framework

## Heat Gets You In. Durability Makes It a Real SaaS Business.

As part of our ongoing effort to build a systematic approach to SaaS product creation, I want to share a framework that has been critical to our success: the Dual-Filter Validation Framework. This framework combines desirability-first validation with a focus on long-term durability—ensuring we build products that people urgently want and will continue to pay for over the next 12-36 months.

Most validation frameworks focus on validating either desirability or durability, but rarely both. The Dual-Filter Validation Framework ensures we catch bad ideas early by assessing both the immediate heat (do people want this now?) and the long-term durability (will this still matter and keep paying in the future?).

In this article, I'll walk you through the two filters, share real examples from our implementation, and discuss how you can apply this framework to your own product creation process. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of how to kill bad ideas faster and double down on the ones that will actually build a sustainable SaaS business.

## Filter 1: The Heat Filter - "Do a Tribe of Real Humans Urgently Want This?"

The first filter in our framework is what we call the "Heat Filter." This is where we validate the immediate desirability of our product or feature idea. We're answering the question: "Do a tribe of real humans urgently want this?"

This is where we leverage the principles of Greg Isenberg's desirability-first methodology. We start by crafting an "Unfair Insight" - a unique perspective on a problem that gives us an advantage over the competition. We then identify our target community, craft a compelling narrative, and run a series of validation tests to gauge real interest and demand.

Some of the key validation tests we run in this phase include:

- **Social Narrative Tests**: We craft multiple narrative variations and test them with our target community to see which one resonates most.
- **Fake Door Tests**: We set up simple landing pages or ads to gauge interest and capture email addresses before building anything.
- **Concierge MVP Tests**: We manually provide the core value of our product to a small group of users to validate the job-to-be-done and willingness to pay.
- **Prepayment/Preorder Tests**: We offer early access or discounted pricing to gauge how many people are willing to pay upfront.

The goal is to uncover a tribe of people who are experiencing acute pain and are eager for a solution. We look for clear signals like waitlists, DMs, preorders, and repeat usage. If we can't find this level of urgency and emotional attachment, we know we need to either pivot or kill the idea.

One of the key lessons we've learned is that heat alone is not enough. Just because people want something doesn't mean they'll actually pay for it long-term. That's where the second filter comes in.

## Filter 2: The Durability Filter - "Will This Still Matter and Keep Paying 12-36 Months from Now?"

The second filter in our framework is what we call the "Durability Filter." This is where we validate the long-term viability and defensibility of our product or feature idea. We're answering the question: "Will this still matter and keep paying 12-36 months from now?"

To assess durability, we look at five key criteria:

1. **Frequency of the Job**: How often does the core job the product solves actually occur? Daily/weekly jobs are more durable than one-time or rare jobs.

2. **Economic Buyer Has Budget**: Does the economic buyer have a dedicated budget for this type of solution, or is it discretionary/hobby spending? Budgeted spend is more durable.

3. **Problem Exists Independent of Hype**: Is the problem the product solves a structural, long-term pain point, or is it driven by a temporary trend or hype cycle? Structural pain is more durable.

4. **Users Would Be Upset If It Disappeared**: How emotionally attached are users to the product? If they'd be genuinely upset if it disappeared, that's a sign of durability.

5. **Clear Path to Switching Costs**: Does the product create meaningful switching costs for users, making it harder for them to leave? Deep integration and data moats create durability.

We score each of these criteria on a 1-5 scale, then add up the total to get an overall Durability Score. Products that score 18-25 points are what we consider "Durable Markets" - compounding SaaS assets worth building for the long-term. Products that score 10-17 are "Cash-Flow Micro-Bets" - short-term revenue opportunities. And anything under 10 is likely a "Low Durability" idea that we should consider pivoting or killing.

The key insight here is that most validation frameworks only focus on the Heat Filter (desirability). They validate that people want the product, but don't assess whether that desire will translate into long-term, durable revenue. By adding the Durability Filter, we catch bad ideas early and ensure we're building products that will still matter and keep paying 12-36 months from now.

## Practical Application: How to Apply the Dual-Filter Framework

So how can you apply the Dual-Filter Validation Framework to your own product creation process? Here are the key steps:

1. **Start with the Heat Filter**: Begin by validating the immediate desirability of your product or feature idea. Run a series of Isenberg-style validation tests to gauge real interest and demand from your target community.

2. **Assess Durability**: Once you've validated the heat, move on to the Durability Filter. Score your idea against the five criteria we outlined: job frequency, budgeted buyer, structural pain, user attachment, and switching costs.

3. **Combine the Filters**: If your idea passes both the Heat Filter and the Durability Filter, you've got a winner. If it fails either filter, consider pivoting or killing the idea.

4. **Build for Durability**: As you move into the build phase, keep the Durability Filter top-of-mind. Design your product with long-term retention and defensibility in mind from the start. Implement features and mechanisms that create switching costs and data moats.

5. **Continuously Validate**: Don't stop validating after the initial idea stage. Continuously assess the heat and durability of your product as you iterate and expand. Be willing to pivot or kill features that no longer meet the criteria.

## Trade-Offs and Limitations

Of course, no framework is perfect, and the Dual-Filter Validation Framework has its own trade-offs and limitations:

**Trade-Offs**:
- **Time and Effort**: Validating both desirability and durability takes more time and effort upfront. It requires a more systematic approach and a larger validation toolkit.
- **Opportunity Cost**: By being more selective, you may miss out on some "quick win" opportunities that don't quite meet the durability bar.
- **Difficulty Assessing Durability**: Predicting long-term durability is inherently challenging. The criteria we use are a best guess, but real-world results may differ.

**Limitations**:
- **Doesn't Guarantee Success**: Even if an idea passes both filters, there's no guarantee it will succeed in the market. Other factors like execution, competition, and market conditions still play a role.
- **Biases Towards Certain Types of Ideas**: The framework may be better suited for certain types of products (e.g. B2B, enterprise) than others (e.g. consumer, lifestyle).
- **Requires Discipline and Rigor**: Consistently applying the framework requires a high degree of discipline and rigor. It's easy to get tempted by "heat" and skip the durability assessment.

Overall, we believe the benefits of the Dual-Filter Validation Framework outweigh the trade-offs. By combining desirability and durability validation, we've been able to build a more defensible and sustainable product creation engine. But it's important to acknowledge the limitations and adapt the framework to your own unique context and goals.

## Takeaways and Next Steps

Here are the key takeaways from the Dual-Filter Validation Framework:

1. **Heat Gets You In, Durability Makes It a Real SaaS Business**: Validating desirability is important, but it's not enough. You need to also assess the long-term durability of your product or feature idea.

2. **The Two Filters: Heat and Durability**: The Heat Filter validates that a tribe of real humans urgently want your solution. The Durability Filter ensures it will still matter and keep paying 12-36 months from now.

3. **Combine Desirability and Defensibility**: Most validation frameworks focus on one or the other. The Dual-Filter approach validates both, helping you catch bad ideas early and double down on the winners.

4. **Design for Durability from the Start**: As you move into the build phase, keep the Durability Filter top-of-mind. Implement features and mechanisms that create switching costs and data moats.

5. **Continuously Validate**: Don't stop validating after the initial idea stage. Continuously assess the heat and durability of your product as you iterate and expand.
