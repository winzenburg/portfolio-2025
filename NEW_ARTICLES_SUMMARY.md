## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

This suite establishes you as **the thought leader** in AI-augmented development:

### Your New Content Pillars

**1. Foundation (What & Why)**
- Autonomous AI Coding - "I woke up to working code"
- AI Coding Economics - "$42 vs $600: The ROI"
- Choosing Your AI Mode - "When I wasted $60 choosing wrong"

**2. Execution (How to Do It)**
- Writing PRDs for AI - "45-minute PRD = $42 success"
- Self-Validating Agents - "Agents that test themselves"

**3. Architecture (Why It Works)** ⭐ DIFFERENTIATOR
- Fresh Context Per Iteration - "Why autonomous doesn't break"
- Compound Intelligence - "Codebases that learn"

**4. Developer Experience** ⭐ UX EXPERTISE
- Integration Docs That Work - "18 minutes vs 3 hours"
