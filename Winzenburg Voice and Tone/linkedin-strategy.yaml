# LinkedIn Publishing Strategy

platform: "LinkedIn"
content_type: "Thought Leadership Posts"

# Core Strategy

strategy:
  approach: "Teaser + Value + CTA"

  philosophy: |
    LinkedIn posts are the appetizer, your site is the full meal.
    Give them enough value to stop scrolling, enough insight to trust you,
    and a clear reason to click through for more.

  content_ratio:
    linkedin: "30% of full article content"
    personal_site: "100% - full depth and detail"

# LinkedIn Post Structure

post_structure:

  ideal_length:
    character_count: "1200-1500 characters"
    paragraph_count: "3-5 paragraphs"
    reading_time: "30-45 seconds"

  anatomy:
    hook:
      purpose: "Stop the scroll in first 2 lines"
      length: "1-2 sentences"
      style: "Punchy, provocative, or relatable"
      examples:
        - "Last week I validated 3 product ideas in 5 days. The old way? 6 weeks."
        - "80% of AI implementations fail. Here's how to be in the 20%."
        - "I spent 40 hours on research. AI did it in 3. Same results."

    value_bomb:
      purpose: "Deliver core insight that makes post valuable on its own"
      length: "2-3 paragraphs"
      content: "The framework, the 'aha', the key takeaway"
      style: "Numbered list or clear breakdown"
      rule: "Even if they don't click through, they got value"

    cta:
      purpose: "Natural transition to full article"
      length: "1 sentence + link location"
      style: "Curiosity-driven, not pushy"
      examples:
        - "Full framework with examples in the article (link in comments)"
        - "I break down the exact process in the full article → link in comments"
        - "Want the complete playbook? Full breakdown on my site (link below)"

    engagement_hook:
      purpose: "Encourage comments and conversation"
      placement: "After CTA or before closing"
      examples:
        - "What's your biggest challenge with AI research?"
        - "Have you tried this approach? What worked for you?"
        - "Which of these frameworks would help you most?"

# Content Adaptation Rules

adaptation_rules:

  from_full_article_to_linkedin:

    step_1_extract_core:
      - "Identify the single most valuable framework or insight"
      - "Pull out the best story or example"
      - "Find the most compelling data point"

    step_2_condense:
      - "Cut 70% of the content"
      - "Keep: Hook, core framework, 1 example, CTA"
      - "Remove: Deep dives, additional examples, tangents"

    step_3_punch_it_up:
      - "Make the hook hookier"
      - "Turn paragraphs into bullet points where possible"
      - "Add line breaks for visual breathing room"
      - "End with engagement question"

  what_to_keep:
    - "Opening story or hook"
    - "Core framework (simplified to 3-5 steps)"
    - "Best statistics or data point"
    - "One concrete example"
    - "Clear value proposition"

  what_to_cut:
    - "Deep explanations (save for site)"
    - "Additional examples beyond the best one"
    - "Detailed tool comparisons"
    - "Nuanced caveats (summarize in one line)"
    - "Background context (assume they'll click for it)"

# LinkedIn-Specific Formatting

formatting:

  line_breaks:
    rule: "Use generously for readability"
    pattern: "Double line break between sections"

  lists:
    style: "Simple bullets or numbers"
    format: |
      1. Point one → quick explanation
      2. Point two → quick explanation
      3. Point three → quick explanation

  emphasis:
    bold: "Not available on LinkedIn (use ALL CAPS sparingly)"
    italics: "Not available (use *asterisks* or quotes)"
    emojis: "Occasional (1-2 per post max)"

  hashtags:
    count: "2-3 maximum"
    placement: "End of post"
    strategy: "Mix of specific and broad"
    examples:
      - "#AIProduct #ProductManagement"
      - "#AITools #UXDesign #DesignOps"
      - "#ProductStrategy #AIBusiness"

# Post Templates by Article Type

templates:

  framework_article:
    structure: |
      [Hook: Problem → surprising solution]

      [Framework name and why it matters]

      Here's the framework:

      1. [Step one] → [quick explanation]
      2. [Step two] → [quick explanation]
      3. [Step three] → [quick explanation]

      [One example of it in action]

      [CTA to full article with link placement]

      [Engagement question]

      #Hashtag #Hashtag

    example: |
      Last Tuesday, I validated three product ideas while making coffee.

      Total time? 30 minutes. Old approach? 3 weeks minimum.

      The difference isn't magic—it's asking AI the right questions.

      Here's the exact framework:

      1. Keyword validation → Find search volume in 5 mins
      2. Pain point research → Use Perplexity for deep insights
      3. Quick competitive scan → AI-powered analysis

      Example: I tested "AI-powered PRD generator" and discovered a gap in
      the market for product managers at Series A startups. Took 28 minutes.

      What's your biggest validation challenge?

      #AIProduct #ProductManagement

  tool_review:
    structure: |
      [Hook: Common problem this tool solves]

      [Tool name + quick description]

      What I learned:

      ✅ [Key benefit 1]
      ✅ [Key benefit 2]
      ⚠️ [Key limitation]

      [Best use case or example]

      [CTA to full review]

      [Question about their tool usage]

    example: |
      Spent 40 hours on market research last month. This month? 3 hours.

      The difference: Perplexity AI for product research.

      What I learned:

      ✅ Answers questions, doesn't just list links
      ✅ Cites sources (so you can verify)
      ✅ Follows up intelligently on your research thread
      ⚠️ Still hallucinates—always verify key facts

      Best use case: Early-stage market validation where you need quick,
      cited answers to specific questions.

  thought_leadership:
    structure: |
      [Provocative statement or counterintuitive claim]

      [Why this matters now]

      [Your key insight or framework]

      [Supporting point or example]

      [Bigger implication]

      [CTA for deeper exploration]

    example: |
      Hot take: The best product managers don't use AI to make decisions.

      They use it to ask better questions.

      I've watched teams try to automate decision-making with AI. It fails
      spectacularly. Why? Because decisions need context, judgment, and nuance.

      But using AI to generate better questions? Game-changer.

      Instead of "Should we build this feature?" ask AI to help you explore:
      - What assumptions am I making?
      - What data would change my mind?
      - What are alternative framings of this problem?

      The questions lead to better decisions. The AI just helps you ask them.

  case_study:
    structure: |
      [Specific outcome achieved]

      [The challenge/starting point]

      [What you did (high-level)]

      [Key results]

      [Biggest lesson]

      [CTA for methodology]

    example: |
      We cut our product validation time from 6 weeks to 6 days.

      The challenge: Our small team couldn't move fast enough to test ideas
      before market windows closed.

      The shift: AI-first validation process
      - Automated keyword research
      - AI-powered competitive analysis
      - Rapid prototype testing with V0

      Results:
      - 90% reduction in validation time
      - 3x more ideas tested per quarter
      - Higher confidence in go/no-go decisions

      Biggest lesson: Speed without sacrificing quality is possible when
      you automate the research, not the judgment.
