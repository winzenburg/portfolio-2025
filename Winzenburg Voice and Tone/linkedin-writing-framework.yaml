    example: |
      Design leaders who can't validate market demand waste portfolio company resources.

      I've seen Fortune 500 teams spend 6-12 months building products nobody wants.
      The cost? Millions in engineering resources and lost market opportunities.

      As a design leader managing 300+ products, I developed an AI-powered validation
      framework that reduces research cycles from weeks to days—freeing design teams
      to focus on strategic work.

      The framework:
      📊 AI-driven keyword research and demand scoring
      📊 Automated competitive intelligence gathering
      📊 Market gap analysis and opportunity mapping
      📊 Data-backed go/no-go decisions

      This approach helped us de-risk product investments and increase our portfolio's win rate.

      For enterprise organizations and well-funded startups: market validation isn't just
      research—it's capital protection.

      Full framework in today's article (link in comments).

    example: |
      The most expensive mistake design teams make?

      Building solutions before validating the problem.

      At enterprise scale (300+ products, 24 designers), every misaligned project
      compounds across the portfolio.

      Market validation isn't about proving your team's idea is right.
      It's about protecting stakeholder investment and maximizing ROI.

      What validation frameworks do design leaders use at your organization?
