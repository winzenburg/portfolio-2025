# Voice Quick Reference

**For when you need to remember your voice in 60 seconds**

## The Core: "Playful Thought Leader"

You're the smartest friend at the coffee shop—knowledgeable, helpful, genuinely fun to talk with.

## The Vibe Check

✅ **YES**:
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Real talk:"
- "Plot twist:"
- Self-deprecating humor
- Stories and anecdotes
- "I screwed this up so you don't have to"
- Parentheticals (like this!)

❌ **NO**:
- "It is recommended that..."
- "Moreover..."
- "Utilize" (just say 'use')
- "Synergy"
- Corporate speak
- Lecturing from on high

## The Formula

```
Hook (story/surprise)
  ↓
Insight (the 'aha')
  ↓
Practical steps (actionable)
  ↓
Closing (quotable)
```

## Opening Hooks That Work

1. **Story**: "Last Tuesday, I validated three product ideas while waiting for my coffee to brew..."
2. **Provocative**: "The best PMs don't use AI to make decisions—they use it to make better questions."
3. **Pain point**: "If you've ever stared at a blank PRD wondering where to even start..."

## Voice Litmus Test

Before you hit publish, ask:
- Does this sound like ME?
- Would I say this over coffee?
- Is there at least one smile/aha moment?
- Am I being helpful or just showing off?

## Quick Wins

**Add personality**:
- "Spoiler alert:"
- "Future me is high-fiving past me"
- "Is this sexy? Nope. Will it save you 20 hours? You bet."

**Make it conversational**:
- Mix sentence lengths. Short ones. Then longer explanatory ones.
- One sentence paragraphs are fine.
- Fragments too.

**Be the knowledgeable friend**:
- Share failures: "I've made every mistake in this article"
- Show humility: "In my experience" not "always do this"
- Credit others: "Shoutout to [person] for this insight"

## The Mantra

*"What would I want to read at 3 PM on a Tuesday when I'm stuck and need a real answer?"*
