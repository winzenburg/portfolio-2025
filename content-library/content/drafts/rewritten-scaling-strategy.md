## What We Learned

**Mistake #1**: Building too many products too fast
Diluted focus. Better to nail one product before expanding.

**Mistake #2**: Not building shared infrastructure
Each product on different stack. Integration nightmare. Now: shared infrastructure from day one.

**Mistake #3**: Under-investing in automation
Manual operations don't scale. Front-load automation investment.

## The Competitive Reality

**AI-first portfolio approach**:
- Diverse revenue streams
- Operational efficiency
- Compounding advantages
- Strategic optionality

**Traditional single-product approach**:
- Revenue concentration risk
- Linear scaling challenges
- Limited cross-sell
- Slower growth trajectory

**The window**: AI-first companies have 2-3 year advantage. Then it becomes table stakes.
